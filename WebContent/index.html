					<h2>
						Cheetahs
					</h2>
					<p>
						The cheetah is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae that occurs
						mainly in eastern and southern Africa and a few parts of Iran. The
						only extant member of the genus Acinonyx, the cheetah was first
						described by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1775. The
						cheetah is characterised by a slender body, deep chest, spotted 
					    coat, a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, 
					    long thin legs and a long spotted tail. Its lightly built, slender 
					    form is in sharp contrast with the robust build of the big cats, 
					    making it more similar to the cougar. The cheetah reaches nearly 
					    70 to 90 cm (28 to 35 in) at the shoulder, and weighs 21–72 kg 
					    (46–159 lb). Though taller than the leopard, it is notably smaller 
					    than the lion. Typically yellowish tan or rufous to greyish white, 
					    the coat is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots.

					<h2>
						Hyenas
					</h2>
					<p>
					Hyenas or hyaenas are any feliform carnivoran mammals of the family 
					Hyaenidae. With only four extant species, it is the 
					fifth-smallest biological family in the Carnivora, and one of the 
					smallest in the class Mammalia. Despite their low diversity, hyenas 
					are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Although phylogenetically they are closer to felines and viverrids, 
					hyenas are behaviourally and morphologically similar to canines in 
					several aspects; both hyenas and canines are non-arboreal, cursorial 
					hunters that catch prey with their teeth rather than claws. Both eat 
					food quickly and may store it, and their calloused feet with large, 
					blunt, nonretractable nails are adapted for running and making sharp 
					turns. However, the hyenas' grooming, scent marking, defecating habits, 
					mating, and parental behaviour are consistent with the behaviour of 
					other feliforms.
